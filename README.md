# MyMed

A personal medical history application and platform that will allow users to manage their doctor’s appointments so keeping track of their medical needs will be that much easier. On the web app, a user can view all upcoming appointments they have added as well as have the ability to add more appointments. A user can also manage their physicians (add new ones and view physician information) and view all past appointments, including notes that may have been uploaded when an appointment is marked as completed. I wanted to show off the skills I developed over the 10 weeks at Launch Academy, as well as create a useful application that would help users make the sometimes overwhelming task of keeping track of their medical needs much more manageable.

## Getting Set Up:

* Navigate to my-med.herokuapp.com
* Login through a google account.
* You will be navigated to the home page but will not be able to make any appointments since you have not added any physicians!
* Navigate to the physicians page and add a few physicians. 
* Now on the home page, you will be able to add appointments.

## To run app on local machine:

* Install Ruby 2.3.3
* In terminal run git clone https://github.com/eschron/breakable-toy.git
* Navigate to the project's root directory
* Run bundle install && nam install && rake db:setup
* In terminal, run rails s
* In another terminal window, run npm start
* Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## Technologies:

React.js Front End with React Router to prevent page reloads.
Ruby on Rails back end with PostgreSQL database.
